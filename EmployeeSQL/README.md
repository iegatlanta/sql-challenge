In this assignment, I have designed tables to hold data in CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data (queries).
The enclosed files are part of the excersize in data analysis and data engineering. 
Included are 6 .csv files, 3 .sql files, and 1 image (.png) file.
The 6 .csv files contain relavent company employee data from the 1980s and 1990s.
The 3 .sql files contain code for table schemata, data queries, and entity relationship diagram (ERD). 
The .png file contains the ERD image.
